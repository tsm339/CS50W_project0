                        ruler of the western empire after the Battle of the Milvian Bridge in 312. In 324, he defeated
                        the eastern Augustus Licinius and re-united the empire under his rule, reigning as sole emperor

                        baptism on his deathbed. He also reformed coinage through the introduction of the gold solidus,
                        and initiated a large-scale building program, crowned by the re-foundation the city of
                        Byzantium as "New Rome", popularly known as Constantinople. He was regarded as the model of all

                            emperor on Marcian's death. He was the first emperor to be crowned by the Patriarch of
                            Constantinople. His reign was marked by the pacification of the Danube frontier and peace
                            with Persia, which allowed him to intervene in the affairs of the western empire,
                            supporting candidates for the throne and dispatching an expedition to recover Carthage from
                            the Vandals in 468. Initially a puppet of Aspar, Leo began promoting the Isaurians as a
                            counterweight to Aspar's Goths, marrying his daughter Ariadne to the Isaurian leader
                            Tarasicodissa (Zeno). With their support, in 471 Aspar was murdered and Gothic power over

                            Ariadne and took the name Zeno, and played a crucial role in the elimination of Aspar and
                            his Goths. He was named co-emperor by his son on 9 February 474, and became sole ruler upon

                            regaining control of the capital in 476. Zeno concluded peace with the Vandals, saw off
                            challenges against him by Illus and Verina, and secured peace in the Balkans by enticing
                            the Ostrogoths under Theodoric the Great to migrate to Italy. Zeno's reign also saw the end
                            of the western line of emperors. His pro-Monophysite stance made him unpopular and his
